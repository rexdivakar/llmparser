    <h1>A Simple Post</h1>
    <p>This is a minimal article with no metadata at all. It only has an H1 and a few paragraphs.
    Despite the lack of metadata, the content extractor should still be able to identify this as
    an article and extract the main content reliably using DOM heuristics.</p>
    <p>The extraction pipeline tries readability-lxml first, then trafilatura, and finally falls
    back to DOM-based heuristics that score block elements by paragraph density.</p>
    <p>Even without JSON-LD, Open Graph tags, or other structured metadata, the article scorer
    should assign a reasonable score based on the presence of an H1, sufficient word count,
    and paragraph structure.</p>
    <p>This test fixture validates that the scraper works even on bare-bones HTML blogs
    without any structured metadata.</p>
