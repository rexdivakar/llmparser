    <h1>How to Build a Blog Scraper</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Jane Smith | January 15, 2024</p>

    <p>Building a blog scraper is a fascinating challenge that combines web crawling,
    HTML parsing, and content extraction techniques. In this guide, we'll walk through
    building a production-quality system that works on any blog without site-specific
    selectors.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>First, you need to understand the structure of the blog you want to scrape.
    The key insight is that blogs, despite their visual variety, all have similar
    structural patterns: a title, some metadata, and a body of content.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-python">import scrapy

class BlogSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'blog'
    start_urls = ['https://example.com/blog']

    def parse(self, response):
        for article in response.css('article'):
            yield {'title': article.css('h1::text').get()}
</code></pre>

    <h2>Handling Different Templates</h2>

    <p>Different blogs use different page templates. The key is to use deterministic
    algorithms rather than site-specific CSS selectors. This approach ensures your
    scraper works across thousands of different blog designs.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use readability-lxml for main content extraction</li>
      <li>Fall back to trafilatura if readability fails</li>
      <li>Use DOM heuristics as a last resort</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Extracting Metadata</h2>

    <p>Most modern blogs include rich metadata in JSON-LD, Open Graph, or Twitter Card
    format. By parsing these structured data sources first, we can reliably extract
    the title, author, publication date, and tags without scraping the visual HTML.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The best scrapers are the ones that work on any site without modification.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>

    <p>When scraping at scale, you need to be polite to the servers you're crawling.
    Use Scrapy's AutoThrottle middleware to automatically adjust your crawl speed
    based on server latency. Respect robots.txt and add appropriate delays between
    requests.</p>

    <p>With these techniques, you can build a scraper that reliably extracts content
    from virtually any blog on the internet, regardless of its technical stack or
    visual design.</p>
